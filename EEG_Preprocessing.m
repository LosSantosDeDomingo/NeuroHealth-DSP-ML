% Purpose of Program
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The purpose of this program is to test how to preprocess raw EEG signal
% data.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Improvement Status
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Immediate Improvements for Current Version:
% --------------------------------------------
% Scan through all the nodes in a single file
    % Do something to the collect section
%  
%
% Possible Improvements for Later Version:
% -----------------------------------------

% Node File Size
arraySize = length(fp1_f7_Arr);

numberofWindows = floor(arraySize / samples);

% Create a matrix
matrixSize = samples * numberofWindows;

% Loop though array
for i = 1 : numberofWindows

    % Interval Information
    startIndex = (i-1) * samples + 1;

    % Insert data into the array
