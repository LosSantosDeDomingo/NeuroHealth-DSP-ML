% Purpose of Program
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The purpose of this program is to test how to preprocess raw EEG signal
% data.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Improvement Status
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Immediate Improvements for Current Version:
% --------------------------------------------
% Scan through all the nodes in a single file
    % Do something to the collect section
%  
%
% Possible Improvements for Later Version:
