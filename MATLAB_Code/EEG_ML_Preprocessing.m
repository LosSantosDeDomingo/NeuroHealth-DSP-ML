% Purpose of Program
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The purpose of this program is to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
% model to classify seizure data by extracting features from EEG recorded
% brain signals. This model can also be used to simulate the overall
% behavior of the system's output when identifying possible seizure data.
% The model will also be implementing Kernel functions such as a Sigmoid,
% Polynomial, and Radial Basis Function (RBF).
