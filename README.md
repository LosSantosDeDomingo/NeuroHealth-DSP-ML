This repo stores MATLAB, Verilog, and C/C++ code for a MIoT Senior Design Project.

MATLAB (Training Model...)
______________________________
Immediate Plans:
MATLAB code provided will cover programs needed to collect data from a seizure database, 
then it will be processed through an FFT and labeled before being trained with an RBF SVM.
The program will also be fed sample code collected from our wearable device while 
in the testing phase to aid us in creating a predictable model of how the overall system
should be behaving.

Future Plans:
The inclusion of EEG data when a user is completing a simple exercise will be used 
as a way to gather baseline data to differentiate between normal signals and false positives.

Verilog (Design Phase)
______________________________
Immediate Plans:
A 256-point FFT will be created through hardware by employing a Hardware Description 
Language (HDL), Verilog. This hardware addition will act as a hardware accelerator 
when processing EEG data that is coming in from our wearable device to our BeagleV-Fire

Future Plans:
