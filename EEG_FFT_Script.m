% Purpose of Program
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The purpose of this program is to breakdown the recorded EEG data
% by employing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The Data collected
% was previously processed in the EEG_Preprocessing program. All
% resulting data gathered from the program will be used to be broken
% down prior to being labeled and sent to SVM_Model program for
% training.

% Immediate Improvements for Current Version:
% --------------------------------------------
% (1) Include graphs to show the signal data before and after
% (2) Save graphs to an external hardware
